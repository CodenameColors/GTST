# GTST V1.0
Time stamp tool i made for my friend Galm. The idea is to make editing notes easier! 
It could also most likely be used by other content creators.

The tool does a couple things after the corect info is given (Filename)
1.) Keeps a stopwatching going for as long as a person is "recording/Streaming".
2.) While the stopwatch is running users can make timestamps.
  2.1.) There are 3 types of time stamps. Marker, Single, and startToEnd(range)
    2.1.1.) All of the time stamps are displayed on the application. It will show the type, the timestamp, and also a section to write in comments.
    2.1.1.) The comments can be added by typing or right clicking and using the quick comment contextmenu.
3.) the timestamps can be activated with hotkeys globally. so it works with external peripherals (Streamdeck, keyboard, etc). AND you don't need to be clicked into the application which is nice
4.) you can set the hot keys of your choice
5.) you can add more comments to the quick comment menu as needed.
6.) when stoping a recording all the timestamp data is saved to a log file
7.) The tool also displays all computer drive free memory to the user.
8.) If the free space percent goes below the desired threshold a sound will play to notify the user they need to clear hard drive space.
9.) Users can set the threshold percent.

 # V1.1 features that will be added.
 1.) temp file will be created and every time a time stamp is created it will save it there. 
 2.) temp file is deleted on recording stopping
 3.) fixing the grabbing keyboard focus issue
 4.) fixing issue where drives don't show.
